                <p>The Cross of Magellan is a popular historical landmark and tourist attraction in the middle of busy Magallanes Street. This important symbol of Cebu was said to have been planted by Magellan on April 14, 1521, when he baptized the first Christian Filipinos, Rajah Humabon and Queen Juana and about 400 followers of the Catholic faith.</p>

                <p>Cebu’s holiest church houses a revered Flemish statuette of the Christ child (Santo Niño) that dates to Magellan’s time. The church’s belfry came crumbling down in the October 2013 earthquake and is being rebuilt. The church is no stranger to hardship. Established in 1565 (the oldest church in the Philippines) and burnt down three times, it was rebuilt in its present form in 1737.</p>
